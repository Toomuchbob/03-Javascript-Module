* This project showcases a password generator that can generate a password up to 128 characters in length

* The user answers a series of prompts and confirms and a password is generated based on user-input

* The prompts are validated and passed through a series of loops to generate each character in the password individually

* The password is then passed into the textarea on the html page in read-only format
